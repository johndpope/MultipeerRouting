# MultipeerRouting

## Project Purpose
Project was created to demonstrate the use of multipeer connectivity. There is a large need for communicating without signal in large events. Although there are communication applications like Firechat the solution still is not enough for the simple purpose of making the event experience easier. After attempting to demo the usage of this, I believe there is a better chance at solving this problem using CoreBluetooth and bluetooth routing to send messages. This will be an ongoing project attempting to use multipeer connectivity to bounce messages through users ending at a final destination. 

## Problems Faced
There seems to be an issue with signal strengths that is only reliable up to 15-25 feet. This is an issue since large events cover thousands of yards in total. With this problem, almopst every user would need to have the application downloaded to bounce these messages.
